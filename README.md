## ShinxSU7

This project involves the design and development of a **STM32-based smart vehicle** that can be controlled manually or autonomously using Bluetooth communication. The vehicle is equipped with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, and it can navigate various paths using Waypoint and Auto modes. The project is based on an innovative communication protocol, system control codes, and advanced sensor calibration to ensure optimal performance.

The vehicle supports various motion tasks and can be controlled in different operational modes: Manual, Waypoint, Auto, and Race.

### Key Features:

- **Bluetooth control** for manual and autonomous driving
- **Auto obstacle detection** using ultrasonic sensors
- **Waypoint navigation** and **Auto mode** with obstacle avoidance
- **Advanced calibration** algorithms for improved motion accuracy

### System Functionality

#### Feat 1: Controller and Vehicle Connection

**Bluetooth Communication**: Connects the remote controller (*LeiJun*) and vehicle (*SU7*). If the handshake times out, an error message is displayed.

**Vehicle Movements**: The vehicle can move forward, backward, rotate, and stop in multiple directions.

#### Feat 2: Obstacle Detection

**Real-time Distance Display**: The vehicle detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensors, displaying distance readings on the screen.

#### Feat 3: Waypoint Mode

**Grid-Based Navigation**: The ground is divided into a 4x4 grid, where obstacles are set manually. The vehicle follows predefined waypoints.

**Route Setting**: Users can set, modify, and send routes to the vehicle.

#### Feat 4: Auto Mode

**Obstacle Detection in Auto Mode**: The vehicle autonomously detects obstacles and selects the optimal route to reach the destination using a breadth-first search algorithm.

#### Feat 5: Race Mode

**Line Tracking**: The vehicle can track guide lines using grayscale sensors for autonomous movement in Race mode.

### Communication Protocol Design

The Bluetooth communication between the controller (*LeiJun*) and the vehicle (*SU7*) follows a cyclic protocol where control codes are sent from LeiJun, SU7 responds with acknowledgment codes, data can be sent in both directions.

The controller sends greeting messages every  â…› second, consuming the message buffer of the vehicle.

A typical communication workflow:

1. The controller sends a control code to the vehicle;
2. The vehicle responds an ACK code;
   - if no data transmission needed, enter the next cycle.
3. Data transmission between the controller and the vehicle;
4. The vehicle sends another ACK, communication completed.
